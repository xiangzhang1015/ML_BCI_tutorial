    "\n",
    "Regarding sampling rate/frequency of the input signal, we generally need to resample the input data in two scenarios. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The first one is to deal with multimodal signals. For example, we want to take advantage of two different input signals: brain signals (EEG) with 1000 Hz sampling rate and heart beat (ECG) with 20 sampling rate. In order to unify the input data and integrate them together, we need to adjust them into a constant samling rate, let's say 200 Hz. The practical operation is straightforwad that sample one instance from each five continue instances in EEG (downsampling), while five is calculated by 1000/200; at the meantime, repeat each instance in ECG for 10 times (upsampling), while 10 is calculated by 200/20. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Resampling can also apply to the scenario that the input signals have very high sampling frequency which we don't need. Take the EEG data with 1000 sampling rate as an example: one background knowledge is that the most useful information in EEG are under 70 Hz, based on Nyquist Sampling Theorem, we only need signals with sampling rate around 140 Hz. To reduce computational cost, it's not compulsory but acceptable to downsample the original high-frequency signal (1000 Hz) to lower-frequency signals (e.g., 200 Hz). "

    "This kind of resampling aims to keep balance between datasets (both training and testing set). For example, we have 1000 positive samples but only 200 negative samples, which is generally called imbalance in machine learning. The classifier can achieve an accuracy of 80% by just blindly predicted the most frequent class (make all predection as positive prediction).     Addressing this issue, we have three typical solutions: \n",
    "1. Downsampling the most frequent class until a more balanced distribution is reached (e.g., randomly selecting examples from the majority class and deleting them from the training dataset). \n",
    "2. Upsampling the least frequent class (e.g., randomly duplicating examples from the minority class). \n",
    "3. Use other evaluation metrics, such as ROC Curves and ROC AUC (ROC Area Under Curve) which could avoid the imbalanced data issue. \n",

It is mainly defined in physiology instead of psychology.[<sup>3</sup>](#refer-anchor-3)  \n",
